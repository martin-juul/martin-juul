### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

Here are some ideas to get you started:

ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on
Scratcher. A music streaming server and client.

Server is made with Laravel. The mobile client in React Native.
Currently it's not public although i do intend on releasing it, once i am happy with the initial implementation.

âš¡ Fun fact:

Every year when Formula 1 is in Belgium. There is a heated discussion on whether a corner is named Eau Rouge or Raidillon.
