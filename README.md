### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on
[Scratcher](https://github.com/martin-juul/scratcher). A music streaming server and client.

Server is made with Laravel. The mobile client in React Native.
Currently it's not public although i do intend on releasing it, once i am happy with the initial implementation.
